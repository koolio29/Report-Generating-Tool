# Report Generating Tool

The tool allows to create reports using a csv file which contains the results of the student. In the current version of the tool, it can generate two types of report. They are overall feedback reports and lecturer specific reports.

The overall feedback report contains:
* Basic statistics of the overall exam.

* Graphs to visualize the averages of individual questions.

The lecturer specific report contains:
* Common item analysis statistics such as difficulty and discrimination of questions.
* Graphs to visulaize the difficulty and discriminations of questions
* Details of the questions which are flagged for review.

In addition, the tool can generate csv files which contains the item analysis of the questions.
